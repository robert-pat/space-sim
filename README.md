# space-sim
Space particle simulation
-----
### Usage & Documentation:
- Simulation
  - Finish the different number keys
    - Key1 -> start simulating
    - Key2 -> pause the simulation
    - Key3 -> prune actors
- Rendering
  - Simple shape rendering is done
  - Set specific pixels from coordinates & convert to/from indices
  - Pixel coloring (and maybe transparency)
-----
### TODOs:
- Rendering
  - Better way to place shapes (spheres, rectangles) in key points of the window (center, etc.)
- Simulation
  - the gravity doesn't apply to all the objects equally / at the same time
  - look at the ordering / combination figuring from the
  - To add to keycodes:
    - Step the simulation
    - Add an object
- Eventually
  - the window takes a bit before anything gets drawn
